Ask how many times to run this simulation and you should see it converging on a 66.67% probability that the contestant wins the car by switching. These are the only two possible scenarios:\n",

    "* Let the user enter the number of doors, so as the number of doors increases, the benefit from switching increases. As an example, consider how it would work with 100 doors. Contest picks a door, Monty Hall shows the contestant that nothing of value is behind 98 of the other doors, and then asks if contestant wants to stick with original choice or switch to the one remaining door. In this example, the contestant clearly had a 1/100 chance of getting car on first try, but if contestant switches, there is a 99/100 chance the car will be behind the remaining door. So your simulation should show that with 100 doors, the benefit from switching occurs 99% of the time."
